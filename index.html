        <h1 id="title">Damon Albarn</h1>
        <div class="newspaper">
          <p>Damon Albarn OBE born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and record
            producer, best known as the frontman of the rock band Blur and as the co-founder, lead vocalist,
            instrumentalist,
            and
            primary songwriter of the virtual band Gorillaz.</p>
          <p>Raised in Leytonstone, East London, and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended the Stanway
            School, where he met
            guitarist Graham Coxon and formed Blur, releasing their debut album Leisure in 1991. After
            spending long periods
            touring
            the U.S., Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s.
            The result was the
            Blur
            albums Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three
            albums received
            critical
            acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a Britpop rivalry with Oasis.
            Subsequent albums such
            as
            Blur (1997), 13 (1999), and Think Tank (2003) incorporated influences from lo-fi, electronic and
            hip hop music.</p>

        <div class="newspaper">
          <p> Albarn formed the virtual band Gorillaz in 1998 with comic book artist Jamie Hewlett. Drawing
            influences from hip hop,
            dub, pop,[2] trip hop,[3] and world music,[4] Gorillaz released their self-titled debut album in
            2001 to worldwide
            success, spawning successful follow-ups Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach, The Fall (both
            released in 2010), Humanz
            (2017), The Now Now (2018) and the first season of their latest project, Song Machine (2020).
            Although Albarn is the
            only permanent musical contributor, Gorillaz albums typically feature collaborations from a
            range of artists. Gorillaz
            are cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the "Most Successful Virtual Band".</p>
